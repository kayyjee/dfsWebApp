<br>
DFS, or Daily Fantasy Sports, is a term used to describe fantasy sports websites that operate on a day to day basis
<br>
<br>
FanDuel and DraftKings are among the most popular at this time
<br>
While many sports are available to be played on these sites, Lacrosse was not an option
<br>
<br>
I made this site to offer lacrosse fans a DFS alternative similar to what they would find on other DFS sites
<br>
<br>
The concept is simple, pick a team before the game starts. When the game starts, your team is locked.
<br>
Sit back and Enjoy the game. Then check back later to see how you did
