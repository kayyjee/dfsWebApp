# Daily Fantasy Sports WebApp

Building a DFS WebApp that specializes in Lacrosse

If you have ever played daily fantasy sports before, this is a simply made, Lacrosse alternative.

There is:
* Creating one team each day
* Salary Cap
* Interpreted from real players & Stats
* Competing against other users
* Downloadable Results Showing how you did

There is NOT:
* Gambling
* Separate Contests each day
* Multiple teams each day

I made the app using the MEAN Stack along with Python Scripts to parse stats and update the results.
